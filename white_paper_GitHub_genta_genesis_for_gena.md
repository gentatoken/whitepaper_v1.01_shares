Genta - Genesis for GENA - Shares & Tokenized (written by Ann Man)

What is GENA.... the Token(Asset) name is Genta and the Symbol is GENA, so every-one knows as GENA, the Tokenized of Shares itself, it define as a Shares that implemented as a Token under Blockchain Network.

the Technical use is under Binance Smart-Chain. What is Binance Smart Chain ? What is Binance ? What is Binance Coin ? What is BNB.....
introduction to the Main-Network that Connecting and Build the GENA, it's called Binance Coin, Symbol: BNB, Binance Coin are the main pair-currency in the Binance Smart Chain, Binance are the Market / Buy/Sell - the most Trusted Biggest Platform for Cryptocurrency Trade-part.

Why we should know about Binance Coin ? the Binance Coin or known as BNB, are the main Pair Currency on the Binance Smart Chain Blockchain, using BEP20 Format Asset Token, users be able firstly to Trade, Hodl, Shares the GENA, by using BNB. Is like the Dollars, the main Currency can be bought directly from Binance, until users Export the BNB to their BEP20 - Main Wallet, means, users had to use the BEP20 Wallet (Web3, or other Mobile-Apps) - after exporting BNB from the main Market, users can Trade GENA in big-announce Chain Market that has been exploid every-where.

Exploit e.g: Users (Trade-BNB) -> Converting into the Shares of GENA (Trade GENA) -> Re-Convert (Trade back to BNB & other Assets) -> Re-Undo the Process for Shares.

 -- GENTA -- 
the Exploitation of Gena are the Shares that used by implementing to Token under Binance Smart-Chain Blockchain network, by having the best Protocol under BSC and Insurance Tokens, it divide to be Distribute & usable directly from main-market that Available for GENA. 
other main-case for Genta (GENA) is the Shares: Protocol Shares. What the Protocol Shares does on GENA, it Distribute up to 50% from total-supply and receive into Validator, the Validator needed to Hodl for 3-months long as Hodl Only, after then turn into other Validator's, validators capacity only available up to: 10,000 Validator in the first Terms for 3-month Period, the Pool Prize for Validator goes by: 0.92 Percentage * 1280 Pixelate *divide* by 32 GENA (Validator one sizes) = 36.8 GENA with the Receiving Pool Prize for each-month.
-Receiving Time: 3x of 3months.
-Multiple Size Wallet: Accepted.
-Rebase & Launch: passed 10,000 Active Wallet on GENA (Under BSC Main-Network). - (re-Base 2nd Phase: halving re-distribute, it's happen once e.g:20,000 Account Activate on GENA, and the Pool Prize going to be Half from the First terms) - (And goes on until Multiple Halving)

-Mechanism of Insurance and Phase of Validator that will active is, one Validator are having about 80% Insurance of Liquidity Pool in GENA Token.
real-proof of Insurance backed assets.

4th Layer Script : 1, 2, 3, 4
1stL. GENA
2ndL. wBNB/wETH
3rdL. Assets (Other contain Assets)
4thL. Shares - Validator

this is the Main Layer that works for using GENA (Shares) - the Shares is under-Layer, 4th Layer = supported by: GENA itself (Insurance), BNB (Asset)/ ETH (Asset), Shares (Validator Jobs Insurance).

/public code - Shares 
the simple ways to Describe what GENA is. GENA are the Token (Shares), Asset that running under Network Blockchain. It define as a Code itself to be Currency, Asset, Shares, and Pro-Generate of Virtual Cash.

/continue public - GENA
People's generating the Fiat -> Cryptocurrency (BNB-mainly assets) -> Generate GENA -> re-Generate into other Cryptocurrency or mainly (BNB).
the Simple way to Describe the Mechanism is the way to use for Mainly Gain Shares.
- using the Cryptography, people can freely-manage their GENA in Decentralized world in Blockchain, for DApps (example), the DApps are the Decentralized Apps that works for Liquidate with other Assets, Decentralized Finance.
Build better Finance on GENA, the Finance Apps on GENA are the many things that can happen. It deploy and re-get base from the fixed price with the Fast network.

/stablecoins - Fiat Currency works (both)
GENA & other Stablecoins can also be work at the same time under Decentralized Apps, with the backed by Liquidity of Stablecoins, GENA can be trade free- &-good cases in the main-network. 

/smart-contract: the smart contract of GENA are using the BEP20 Format Asset Token.
: 0x7f4959528D4C9c7379b3437C7Eea40376fD96B8a (can be found on Explorer - BSC Scan & other BEP20 Explorer)

/transparency - of GENA
Since GENA are the Token under Decentralized world, users/participant can found their Transparent report on the Blockchain, mostly used by TXN ID, the hash TX (Transactions).
Also with the Details in it, the Decentralized World are meant to be fully-Transparent. 
Every-Participant can see each-other Balance without knowing the Identity, it is the Anonymous. 

/distribute - GENA
GENA (Symbol), are the Shares distribute asset, that have more than 100 Million supplied on the Global-space Main-Network.

Shares constructions: 
-math function GENA: 10*1280 (pixels)*0.92(percentage locked)*10000 (distribution) 
Locked for 0.92% onto Smart-Contract of Genta: 0x7f4959528D4C9c7379b3437C7Eea40376fD96B8a for 1,083,392.000004246439 Million GENA already been locked as 3275827 6594 Block Confirmations.
the Capability of locking the GENA in the smart-contract is to Reveal the real Proof unTouched asset shares, it goes to Smart-Contract to none-spendable asset function.
-0.92% from total Supply can-not be used*, it's only hodl and stayed on the Smart-Contract, instead of Burning, 0.92% are the Implemented as Locking Asset that can not be use for long-terms/all time period.

Pixelate-10 & 1280 Pixels are the Pixels of GENA artwork formated pixel, it goes to 128:*10 instead of 124:*10 (appreciate numbers).

10,000 Distribute are cound as the Future distribute for 32 GENA validator, it only runs 10,000 validator for every(3-months active validator) as it mention above. -- GENA 2.0 (unrealease) phase:0 it will roll-out after 10,000 account Activated on the GENA, BSC - Blockchain Network.

Result: 117,760,000 Million GENA as the Maximum supplied that can be  "spend" & "use"

-----

Distribute Allocate: 
50% -- Allocated as Storage Shares
30% -- uses for GENA 2.0 (Validator) (it will rebase & re-Distribute as circle in the Circulations for 30% maximum stocks Shares)
10% -- Insurance of GENA
5% -- Cap Circulation in first-terms
3.08% -- Team & Developers
1% -- Network Security

...extra Functions: minted, burning, frozend funds.
